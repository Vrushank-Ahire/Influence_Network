# Student Network Analysis

This repository contains code and analysis related to a student network dataset obtained as part of a Discrete Mathematics class. The dataset captures interactions and connections between students, and the repository provides implementations of various algorithms and techniques to gain insights from this network data.

## Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Random Walk**: Implement a random walk algorithm to identify the most influential student, termed the "Super Winner," in the network.
2. **Missing Link Prediction**: Apply matrix factorization techniques to predict missing connections or relationships between students in the network.
3. **At-Risk Student Identification**: Develop a methodology to identify students who may be at risk of academic difficulties or social isolation based on their network connections and centrality measures.

## Repository Structure

- `Data Preprocessing/`: Scripts and code related to data preprocessing.
- `Random Walk/`: Implementation of the random walk algorithm for finding the Super Winner.
- `Finding Missing Links/`: Code for predicting missing links using matrix factorization techniques.
- `Identification of At-Risk Students/`: Methodology and code for identifying at-risk students based on network analysis.
